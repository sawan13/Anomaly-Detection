COMPARISON: OUR VISUALIZATIONS vs TEAM EXTRACTION IMAGE
================================================================================

FILE: Team extraction\undefined.png

WHAT WE CAN DETERMINE (without seeing it):
- It's a PNG image file
- Named "undefined" (suggests automated generation or placeholder)
- Located in Team extraction folder (team's previous work)

================================================================================
OUR VISUALIZATIONS (What we created):
================================================================================

1. boxplot_features_by_dataset.png
   ├─ 5 subplots (one per feature)
   ├─ Features: rms, std, variance, crest_factor, peak_to_peak
   ├─ Groups by: Dataset × Classification (Normal/Anomaly)
   ├─ Shows: Quartiles, median, outliers, range
   └─ Purpose: Feature behavior across datasets

2. violinplot_features_distribution.png
   ├─ 5 subplots
   ├─ Shows distribution shape (not just summary)
   ├─ Compares: Normal vs Anomaly distributions
   ├─ Reveals: Multimodal distributions, overlaps
   └─ Purpose: Distribution characteristics

3. barplot_features_statistics.png
   ├─ 5 subplots
   ├─ Shows: Mean ± Std for each feature
   ├─ Color-coded: Green (Normal), Red (Anomaly)
   ├─ Dataset breakdown: AGR.361, AGR.561, BIS.361, BSK.362
   └─ Purpose: CLEAREST visual comparison (BEST FOR DECISIONS)

4. anomaly_analysis_by_dataset.png
   ├─ 4 subplots:
   │  ├─ Stacked bar chart (Normal vs Anomaly counts)
   │  ├─ Percentage comparison (Anomaly rate %)
   │  ├─ Box plots (MSE distribution by classification)
   │  └─ Heatmap confusion matrix (count visualization)
   ├─ Grouped by: Dataset (AGR.361, AGR.561, BIS.361, BSK.362)
   └─ Purpose: System performance overview

5. reconstruction_error_hist.png
   ├─ Single histogram plot
   ├─ Shows: Distribution of reconstruction MSE
   ├─ Red line: Anomaly threshold (mean + 2×std)
   ├─ Reveals: How well normal/anomaly are separated
   └─ Purpose: Reconstruction error methodology

================================================================================
STRENGTHS OF OUR APPROACH:
================================================================================

✅ DIAGNOSTIC DEPTH
   - Examines each of 5 time-domain features individually
   - Not just overall system performance

✅ STATISTICAL RIGOR
   - Shows mean, std, quartiles, distribution shape
   - Not just binary classifications

✅ DATASET CONSISTENCY
   - Compares AGR.361 vs AGR.561 (important!)
   - Validates model works across different machinery

✅ ANOMALY MECHANISM UNDERSTANDING
   - Clearly shows which features change when anomalies occur
   - Helps understand WHAT is being detected

✅ RECONSTRUCTION METHODOLOGY
   - Shows the threshold setting logic (mean + 2×std)
   - Transparent about how anomalies are flagged

✅ MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES
   - Box plots (quartiles)
   - Violin plots (distribution shape)
   - Bar plots (mean ± std) ← MOST USEFUL
   - Heatmap (confusion matrix)
   - Histogram (error distribution)

WHAT TEAM IMAGE LIKELY CONTAINS (Possibilities):
================================================================================

POSSIBILITY 1: Confusion Matrix
   True Positive  │ False Positive
   ───────────────┼─────────────────
   False Negative │ True Negative
   
   ✓ Good for: Overall accuracy metrics
   ✗ Missing: Feature-level analysis
   ✗ Missing: Dataset comparison

POSSIBILITY 2: ROC Curve

   ✓ Good for: Trade-off analysis
   ✗ Missing: Feature insights
   ✗ Missing: Real data distribution

POSSIBILITY 3: Feature Importance
   Bar chart showing which features matter most
   
   ✓ Good for: Feature ranking
   ✗ Missing: Statistical details
   ✗ Missing: Dataset breakdown

POSSIBILITY 4: Time Series Plot
   Sensor readings over time with anomalies marked
   
   ✓ Good for: Temporal context
   ✗ Missing: Statistical analysis
   ✗ Missing: Feature comparison

POSSIBILITY 5: Reconstruction Error Plot
   Similar to our histogram
   
   ✓ Likely comparable to ours
   ? Depends on quality and detail

================================================================================
WHICH IS BETTER?
================================================================================

If Team Image is a Confusion Matrix / ROC Curve:
   → OURS are BETTER for:
   ✓ Understanding the data
   ✓ Feature-level insights
   ✓ Dataset validation
   ✓ Diagnostic purposes
   
   → Their image is BETTER for:
   ✓ Overall performance summary
   ✓ Stakeholder communication (simple)

If Team Image is Feature Importance / Time Series:
   → OURS are BETTER for:
   ✓ Statistical rigor
   ✓ Distribution analysis
   ✓ Multiple perspectives
   
   → Their image might be BETTER for:
   ✓ Temporal understanding
   ✓ Business context

================================================================================
IDEAL SCENARIO: COMBINE BOTH APPROACHES
================================================================================

COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS WOULD INCLUDE:

OUR VISUALIZATIONS:
✓ boxplot_features_by_dataset.png       → Feature behavior
✓ barplot_features_statistics.png       → Mean comparison
✓ violinplot_features_distribution.png  → Distribution shape
✓ anomaly_analysis_by_dataset.png       → System overview
✓ reconstruction_error_hist.png         → Error methodology

PLUS Team's Visualization:
+ undefined.png                         → (Their approach)

TOGETHER = Complete picture:
- Feature analysis (ours)
- Overall performance (theirs)
- Statistical details (ours)
- Business metrics (theirs potentially)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

NEXT STEPS:

1. VIEW the Team extraction\undefined.png image
   - What type of visualization is it?
   - What metrics does it show?
   - What dataset size did they use?

2. COMPARE the metrics:
   - If they show accuracy/precision/recall → compare with our 2.5% anomaly rate
   - If they show ROC curve → compare with our feature separation
   - If they show feature importance → compare with our feature analysis

3. ASSESS which is more useful:
   - For UNDERSTANDING the data → Use OUR visualizations
   - For EXPLAINING to management → Combine both
   - For DEBUGGING the system → Use OUR visualizations
   - For VALIDATING accuracy → Use THEIR metrics (if available)

4. POTENTIAL ISSUES WITH TEAM IMAGE:
   ⚠ Name "undefined" suggests:
     - Automated plot without title?
     - Incomplete analysis?
     - Different methodology?

5. QUALITY INDICATORS:
   Check their image for:
   ✓ Clear labels (axes, legend)
   ✓ Informative title
   ✓ High resolution
   ✓ Color-blind friendly
   ✓ Consistent with their data

================================================================================
VERDICT (Without seeing it):
================================================================================

LIKELY SCENARIO:
Their image = High-level performance metric
Our images = Low-level feature analysis

BEST PRACTICE:
Use BOTH for complete understanding:
- Theirs for "Does it work?"
- Ours for "Why does it work?"
